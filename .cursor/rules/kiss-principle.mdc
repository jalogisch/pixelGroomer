# KISS Principle

**Keep It Simple, Stupid** - When making technical decisions, always prefer the simpler solution.

## When to Apply

Apply the KISS principle when:

- Choosing between technologies or frameworks
- Designing architecture or system structure
- Implementing features
- Adding dependencies
- Solving problems

## Decision Guidelines

### 1. Technology Selection

Prefer technologies that:
- Have fewer dependencies
- Are well-established and maintained
- Have clear documentation
- Solve the problem without over-engineering

**Example:** For this project, we chose Flask + Jinja2 + HTMX over a full SPA framework because:
- Server-side rendering is simpler to debug
- No build step required
- Fewer moving parts
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 2. Architecture

- Prefer flat structures over deep nesting
- Avoid premature abstraction
- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Only add complexity when proven necessary

### 3. Implementation

```bash
# ❌ Over-engineered
function process_file() {
    local file="$1"
    local strategy="${2:-default}"
    local validator="${3:-basic}"
    local processor_factory
    processor_factory=$(get_processor_factory "$strategy")
    # ... 50 more lines
}

# ✅ Simple
function process_file() {
    local file="$1"
    cp "$file" "$DEST_DIR/"
}
```

### 4. Dependencies

Before adding a dependency, ask:
- Can this be done with existing tools?
- Is the dependency well-maintained?
- Does it add significant value over a simple implementation?

## Workflow Design

**Every workflow step is optional.** The only requirement is at least one step.

For PixelGroomer:
- Import photos from SD card
- Develop existing RAWs
- Set EXIF on existing photos
- Create albums from archive
- Any combination of the above

Each step works independently. Never force users through steps they do not need.

## Trade-offs

KISS does not mean:
- ❌ Ignoring best practices
- ❌ Skipping error handling
- ❌ Writing unmaintainable code
- ❌ Avoiding all abstraction

KISS means:
- ✅ Choosing the right level of complexity
- ✅ Starting simple, adding complexity only when needed
- ✅ Preferring readable over clever code
- ✅ Solving the actual problem, not hypothetical ones
- ✅ Making every workflow step optional

## Project Examples

| Decision | KISS Choice | Rejected Alternative |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Web UI | Flask + HTMX | React/Vue SPA |
| Config format | YAML + .env | Custom DSL |
| Module system | YAML descriptor + Python | Plugin architecture |
| Form persistence | sessionStorage | State management library |
| Theme switching | CSS swap | Full page reload |
