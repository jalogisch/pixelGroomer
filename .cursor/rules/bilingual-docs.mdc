# Bilingual Project Convention

This project is maintained in two languages: German (DE) and English (EN).

## Documentation

All documentation files must exist in both languages:

```
README.md          # English (primary)
README.de.md       # German

doc/workflow.en.md
doc/workflow.de.md
```

### Naming Convention

- `*.en.md` - English version
- `*.de.md` - German version
- `README.md` - English (exception, as primary entry point)
- `README.de.md` - German

### Cross-linking

Each documentation file must link to its counterpart at the top:

```markdown
# Title

*[English Version](filename.en.md)*
```

or

```markdown
# Title

*[Deutsche Version](filename.de.md)*
```

## Scripts and Code

- All script output, help texts, and log messages: **English only**
- Code comments: **English only**
- Variable/function names: **English only**

## English Style

Write English as a proficient non-native speaker would:
- Clear and direct
- No complex idioms
- Technically precise
- Simple sentence structures

## When Creating New Documentation

1. Always create both language versions
2. Keep content synchronized between versions
3. Update both when making changes
