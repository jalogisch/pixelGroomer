# Documentation & Examples Theme

All documentation and examples use a consistent theme around **motorcycle adventure photography**.

## Target Audience

The user is an adventure motorcycle rider and photographer who:
- Attends enduro training events
- Participates in motorcycle rallies and meets
- Takes motorcycle holidays / tours
- Photographs at off-road and adventure events

## Example Event Types

Use these event types in documentation and examples:

| Event Type | Example Names |
|------------|---------------|
| Enduro training | "Endurotraining", "GS Trophy Training" |
| Rally/Competition | "Erzbergrodeo", "Red Bull Romaniacs", "Sea to Sky" |
| Motorcycle tour | "Alps Tour", "Pyrenees Adventure", "Norway Crossing" |
| Bike meet/gathering | "GS Treffen", "Adventure Meeting", "BMW Motorrad Days" |
| Off-road workshop | "Trail Riding Workshop", "Navigation Training" |

## Example Locations

Use real locations that fit the motorcycle/adventure theme:

| Location | GPS | Context |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Stadtoldendorf | 51.875222,9.648111 | Enduro training at enduroXperience |
| Erzberg, Austria | 47.4833,14.9833 | Famous hard enduro competition |
| Sölk Pass, Austria | 47.2833,14.0833 | Scenic alpine motorcycle route |
| Mandello del Lario | 46.0667,9.3167 | Moto Guzzi factory/museum |
| Dolomites, Italy | 46.4333,11.8500 | Classic motorcycle touring region |

## Terminology

Use these terms consistently:

### Events
- **Event** (not "shoot", "session") - A motorcycle event being photographed
- **Training day** / **Training weekend** - Enduro or off-road instruction
- **Tour** - Multi-day motorcycle journey
- **Meet** / **Gathering** - Motorcycle rider meetup

### Photography
- **Action shots** - Photos of riders in motion
- **Pit photos** - Photos in service/rest areas
- **Landscape shots** - Scenic photos during tours
- **Group photos** - Rider gatherings

### File naming in examples
- Use event-related names: `Endurotraining`, `AlpsTour`, `GSTreffen`
- Avoid generic names like "Wedding", "Birthday", "Family"

## Example Patterns

### Good examples

```bash
# Import from enduro event
pg-import /Volumes/EOS_DIGITAL --event "Endurotraining" --location "Stadtoldendorf"

# Album for tour highlights
pg-album create "Alps_Tour_2026"

# Export for event participants
pg-album export "GS_Treffen_Highlights" --to ~/Desktop/ForRiders/
```

### Avoid

```bash
# ❌ Generic non-motorcycle examples
pg-import /Volumes/SD --event "Wedding" --location "Berlin"
pg-album create "Birthday_Party"
```

## .import.yaml Examples

```yaml
# Enduro training
event: "Endurotraining Tag 1"
location: "Stadtoldendorf"
tags:
  - enduro
  - offroad
  - training

# Motorcycle tour
event: "Alps Tour 2026"
location: "Sölk Pass"
tags:
  - tour
  - alps
  - adventure
```

## Watermark Examples

- "Jan Doberstein - enduroXperience"
- "pixelpiste"
- Event name + photographer

## Synchronization Requirement

When updating examples in documentation:
1. Check if the same example exists in other doc files
2. Update all language versions (EN and DE)
3. Verify example scripts match the documented examples
